I am starting my journey in Computer Vision. I have started my journey by learning OpenCv from a youtube video uploaded by freeCodeCamp.org(the link is in the resources field) and I will be learning from a book written by Dr. Adrian Rosebrock called "Deep Learning For Computer Vision With Python". This repository will contain the things I have learnt on my journey to Computer Vision

**Day 1 of 300DaysOfDeepLearningForComputerVision!**
In Day1, I learned how to read and show photos and videos on screen using OpenCv. In addition to this I also learned how to rescale and resize image and video frames and draw shapes like rectangle, circle and straight line and write text on images.
